I also have this problem.
Set mime-type is temporary solution for it.

- url: /server/static/css/*
  mime_type: text/css
    static_dir: server/static/css



    Use POST for destructive actions such as creation (I'm aware of the irony), editing, and deletion, because you can't hit a POST action in the address bar of your browser. Use GET when it's safe to allow a person to call an action. So a URL like:

    http://myblog.org/admin/posts/delete/357

    Should bring you to a confirmation page, rather than simply deleting the item. It's far easier to avoid accidents this way.

    POST is also more secure than GET, because you aren't sticking information into a URL. And so using GET as the method for an HTML form that collects a password or other sensitive information is not the best idea.

    One final note: POST can transmit a larger amount of information than GET. I don't remember the exact constraints of each, but the advantage is significant.
 Responses to GET requests might be cahched. Responses to POSTs must not.
